# Netic: Genetic Network Protocol Fuzzer

This Rust program is a genetic fuzzer for testing protocol implementations. The fuzzer utilizes evolutionary algorithms and heuristics to generate test cases that can potentially uncover bugs in the target protocol implementation. The primary components of the fuzzer are message sequences, state models, and fitness evaluation.
Overview

The fuzzer operates in the following stages:

    Initialization: In the beginning, the fuzzer initializes a corpus of message sequences and a message pool. The corpus is a collection of test cases, while the message pool is a collection of individual messages used for mutation and crossover operations.

    Execution: The fuzzer iteratively executes the following steps for a specified number of generations:
        Run message sequences from the corpus and record their interaction history.
        Update the message pool with randomly selected messages from the current message sequences.
        Process the interaction history to update the state model and identify unique and rare server states.
        Evaluate the fitness of each message sequence in the corpus based on coverage, state rarity, and other criteria.
        Evolve the generation by applying selection, crossover, and mutation operations to create a new generation of message sequences.

Notable Features

    Genetic Algorithm: The fuzzer uses a genetic algorithm to evolve message sequences, applying selection, crossover, and mutation operations. This helps explore diverse and potentially interesting test cases.

    State Model: The program builds and updates a state model of the server based on the server's responses to message sequences. This helps guide the fuzzer towards new and unexplored states.

    Fitness Evaluation: The fuzzer evaluates the fitness of message sequences based on various criteria, such as state coverage, state rarity, and other heuristics. This allows the fuzzer to prioritize promising test cases.

    Configuration: The fuzzer provides a configurable framework with parameters for controlling the fuzzing process, such as selection pressure, mutation rate, crossover rate, message pool size, and state rarity threshold.

Usage

To use the fuzzer, you need to implement the required traits for your protocol and configure the fuzzer with the desired parameters. The fuzzer can then be run against the target protocol implementation to generate test cases and uncover potential issues.

Please refer to the source code for more details on implementing the required traits and configuring the fuzzer.
